# BoXHED2.0

**Bo**osted e**X**act **H**azard **E**stimator with **D**ynamic covariates v2.0 (BoXHED2.0, pronounced 'box-head') is a software package for nonparametrically estimating hazard functions via gradient boosted trees. BoXHED2.0 accommodates both time-static and time-dependent covariates.

Please refer to [Pakbin et al. (2023)](#suggested-citations) for details, which is a major extension of BoXHED1.0 ([Wang et al. 2020](#suggested-citations)). The theoretical underpinnings for BoXHED is provided in [Lee, Chen, Ishwaran (2021)](#suggested-citations).

What’s new (over BoXHED1.0):
 - Allows for survival data beyond right censoring, including recurrent events, and cause-specific hazards in competing risks settings
 - Significant speedup from data preprocessing and C++ codebase
 - Multicore CPU and GPU support
 - Integrated [TreeSHAP](https://github.com/shap/shap) support for interpretable explanations of estimated log-hazard values

## Prerequisites
The software was developed and tested in Linux, Mac OS, and Windows10 environments. The requirements are the following:
- Python (=3.8)
- conda  (we recommend using the free [Anaconda distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/))


## Setting up BoXHED2.0
1. **[Windows users only]** Install Visual Studio 17 2022 toolset. During installation, under the "Workloads" tab select "Desktop Development with C++" in the "Desktop and Mobile" section. Make the following selections in the menu on the right: ![sc__](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34462617/201495851-c7d02796-31e0-4181-9eba-78065d2a5f59.png)

2. Set up a dedicated virtual environment for BoXHED2.0. This ensures that BoXHED2.0 will not interfere with any existing XGBoost packages. This implementation uses python 3.8. In this example we use [Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to open a terminal. First, create a virtual environment called boxhed2:
```
conda create -n boxhed2 python=3.8
```

then activate it
```
conda activate boxhed2
```

3. Install the version dependencies by pasting the following lines into your terminal:
```
pip install matplotlib==3.7.1
pip install pillow==9.4.0
pip install numpy==1.24.3
pip install scikit-learn==1.2.2
pip install pytz==2023.3
pip install pandas==1.5.3
pip install cmake==3.26.3
pip install py3nvml==0.2.7
pip install tqdm==4.65.0
pip install threadpoolctl==3.1.0
pip install scipy==1.10.1
pip install joblib==1.2.0
pip install chardet==5.2.0
pip install slicer==0.0.7
pip install numba==0.57.1
pip install cloudpickle==2.2.1
pip install --force-reinstall --upgrade python-dateutil
pip install jupyter
```
If there are any issues with the `pip` installation for any of the packages above, you can use `conda install` to install them instead.

4. **[Mac users only]** Install OpenMP 11.1.0 to enable multithreaded CPU operation:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenrui333/homebrew-core/0094d1513ce9e2e85e07443b8b5930ad298aad91/Formula/libomp.rb
brew unlink libomp
brew install --build-from-source ./libomp.rb
```
Without OpenMP, BoXHED2.0 will only use a single CPU core, which slows down training and fitting. Also, if OpenMP is not present, setting the variable `nthread` in the tutorial to a value other than 1 may result in a runtime error.

5. Download one of the following pre-built zipped packages for your operating system:
* [BoXHED Linux CPU](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bi5bkae5ahzedej5gskdl/boxhed_linux_cpu.zip?rlkey=il9zv150xncw5awk9i7hhvzu4&dl=0)
* [BoXHED Linux GPU+CPU](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f5b51d3njlr61fjpk98w0/boxhed_linux_gpu.zip?rlkey=l41bb5egv9ies5v48mvcs20f2&dl=0)
* [BoXHED Win10 CPU](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kpz0y8ko7s4aqwdpx5gwu/boxhed_win10_cpu.zip?rlkey=qgy4mkbl78b4vk73tg1m8t32q&dl=0)
* [BoXHED Win10 GPU+CPU](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wxqfsztoogdsawcev0b6o/boxhed_win10_gpu.zip?rlkey=vc22sgypo9c2oqf2kvkgdhvip&dl=0)
* [BoXHED OSX CPU M1](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2rztizbhhm7h8rigl2gmb/boxhed_osx_cpu_M1.zip?rlkey=q9232o0pphhd0eoq5ggbiyzhk&dl=0)
  
and place the unzipped contents into the directory returned by the following command: 
```
python -c "import sys; site_packages = next(p for p in sys.path if all([k in p for k in ['boxhed2', 'site-packages']])); print('\n'*2); print(site_packages); print('\n'*2)"
```

For example, the command line above may return the following directory:
```
/home/grads/d/j.doe/anaconda3/envs/boxhed2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/
```

After placing the unzipped contents into this directory, the following folders should exist:
```
/home/grads/d/j.doe/anaconda3/envs/boxhed2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/boxhed/
/home/grads/d/j.doe/anaconda3/envs/boxhed2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/boxhed_kernel/
/home/grads/d/j.doe/anaconda3/envs/boxhed2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/boxhed_prep/
/home/grads/d/j.doe/anaconda3/envs/boxhed2/lib/python3.8/site-packages/boxhed_shap/
```

6. Download the files in this repository and put them in a directory called BoXHED2.0. Then go to the directory:
```
cd BoXHED2.0
```

7. Run *BoXHED2_tutorial.ipynb* for a demonstration of how to fit a BoXHED hazard estimator:
```
jupyter notebook BoXHED2_tutorial.ipynb
```
For Mac users, Apple's security system may complain about the precompiled components of BoXHED2.0. In that case, the instructions on [this page](https://www.easeus.com/computer-instruction/apple-cannot-check-it-for-malicious-software.html) will be helpful.
